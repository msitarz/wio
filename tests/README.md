# wio test strategy

How wio is tested. Written for a coding agent or human starting work in the wio
repo. It covers the test layers, the directory layout and the conventions.

## 1. Principles

- **Fast by default.** `uv run pytest` runs the fast tests, and `make slow`
  runs the slow ones.
- **Start small.** Add helpers and vocabulary only when a test needs them.
  Delete tests and helpers that have no observed failure behind them.

## 2. Test layers

| Layer | Location | Use for | Do not use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | `tests/unit/` (mirrors `src/wio/`) | One component's logic run against fakes of its ports, and its functions on their own when a case is hard to reach through the public entry | Anything with something real behind it (integration); what a user sees (acceptance) |
| Integration | `tests/integration/` (mirrors `src/wio/`) | Code with something real behind it: an adapter on real git or a real disk, the process's working directory and environment, a fresh interpreter (what an import loads), the installed command | Behaviour a user relies on (acceptance); input tables (unit) |
| Tooling | `tests/tooling/` | The repository's own configuration, layout and hygiene as its tools see them: lint rules probed with `ruff`, what git ignores, the stub rules of the ports, that the sources and the sample config agree with the models | The behaviour of wio |
| Acceptance | `tests/acceptance/` (mirrors features) | Behaviour a user or skill relies on: rule selection, contract check results, config validation, record checks, exit codes | Exhaustive input tables, flag parsing details |
| Golden | `tests/golden/` (expected files only) | Byte-stable output (context bundles, rendered templates) | Anything with timestamps or ordering that is not deterministic. Update goldens deliberately and review the diff |

The `tests/packaging/` and `tests/scripts/` directories are two more groups,
for the built package and for the scripts of the repository.

**Which group a test belongs to.** Ask in this order, and take the first yes:

1. Does it assert on what a user or a skill sees, through the DSL or the CLI
   channel? It is an acceptance test: one acceptance criterion of a Work
   contract, one scenario. Only when you write one, read the [acceptance test
   guide](acceptance/README.md).
2. Does it check a tool's configuration or the files of the repository, such as
   a lint rule, an ignored file or the layout of the sources? It is a tooling
   test.
3. Does something real stand behind the code it calls: git, files whose state it
   depends on, the working directory or the environment of the process, a fresh
   interpreter, the installed command? It is an integration test, however fast
   it runs.
4. Otherwise one module is tested with its collaborators replaced, and it is a
   unit test. A `tmp_path` directory that only gives the code an inert input
   does not make a unit test an integration test; a test that asserts on what
   the real disk does does.

A file that mixes the two is split: the unit tests stay in `tests/unit/...`, and
the rest moves to the same path under `tests/integration/` or `tests/tooling/`.

**Markers.** Every directory under `tests/` that holds tests is a group, and
its marker is its name, which `tests/conftest.py` sets from the path, so a test
never carries another group's marker by hand. A new group is a directory, a
registered marker and a module in `tach.toml`.

`slow` is separate from the group. It says that a test spawns a subprocess or
builds the package, and the default run leaves it out. An integration test with
only a temporary directory is not slow and runs by default.

Not covered here: LLM behaviour of skills (`wio-define`, and the review skills
that come later). That
belongs to `wio-eval`. Acceptance tests cover the deterministic engine under the
skills, for example the command sequence a skill runs.

## 3. Directory layout

`tests/` has one directory for each group of section 2, and `fixtures/` for the
static sample repos, example templates and rulesets. `conftest.py` holds the
fixtures that every test can ask for, `fakes.py` the fakes that unit and
integration tests share, `sandbox.py` the sandbox of a test, and `support.py`
what several groups need. The unit and integration directories mirror
`src/wio/`.

## 4. Conventions

- Test names state the behaviour:
  `test_reviewer_only_rules_never_reach_the_author_stage`.
- Every test has `# Given`, `# When` and `# Then` comments, in that order. Each
  comment describes its section in the domain's terms ("When its problems are
  computed"), not the code ("When calling `message_problems`"), so it stays
  true when names change. Assign the result in the When section and assert on
  it in the Then section, rather than computing inside the `assert`. A section
  may be empty only when there is nothing to put in it, and its comment stays
  (`# Given no setup`).
- A test that spawns a subprocess (git, the CLI) or builds the package is
  marked `slow`. `make slow` runs those tests, and CI runs that target.
- A test lives in the group its subject asks for (see section 2).
- Use `tmp_path` and the `sandbox` fixture for every repo, so a test never
  touches the developer's own state: the real Wio home or their git setup.
- No sleeps. No timestamps in compared output.
