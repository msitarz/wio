# <Work name>

<!--
- Replace the heading with the Work name.
- Remove all instruction comments before publishing.
- Keep only the relevant headings unless instruction comment says REQUIRED.
- Follow the shared [writing standard](README.md#writing).
- Use relative Markdown links.
-->

## Purpose

<!-- Write one sentence stating **why** this change is needed. REQUIRED. -->

## Goals

<!-- REQUIRED.

This section is meant to summarize intended capabilities.

- List goals of this Work contract, each in one sentence.
-->

## Glossary

<!--
- Define terms whose meaning could be ambiguous in this Work.
- Reuse established repository meanings.
- Link to shared definitions where useful.
- Omit this section when unnecessary.

Example:
- Model: a data structure whose constructor establishes its field and cross-field invariants.
-->

## Non-Goals

<!-- List non-goals of this Work contract, each in one sentence. -->

## Mechanisms

<!--
- Use an unordered list with one sentence per mechanism, naming the tool, package, module, or data structure central to the solution and explaining its role.
- Be specific—for example, `codex sandbox` rather than `codex`.
- Put acceptance requirements in the relevant AC.
- Keep necessary shared contracts in clearly named subsections, using single-sentence bullets for parallel rules.

Example:

- `codex sandbox`: runs child commands with restricted filesystem access.
- `git worktree`: provide separate checkout directory to prevent concurrent edits issues.
-->

## Inherited constraints

<!-- Optional.

- Link to the parent-owned constraints that apply to this Work.
- State any local constraints it adds.

A parent owns these shared constraints without predefining every signature:
- Concepts and invariants.
- Responsibilities, dependency direction, and effect limits.

Children inherit parent constraints without restating or weakening them.

For every non-functional requirement:
- State whether the local Work, an architectural integration, or the full system verifies it.
- Name the responsible verifier.
- For a quantitative requirement, specify its threshold and the workload and measurement conditions needed to interpret it.
- For a qualitative constraint, name an appropriate verification method and scope; do not require a numeric target.

A child can verify its local portion and complete its own outcome while the parent's system-level guarantee remains unverified. The parent verifies that guarantee across the integrated result.

Example: A parent requires p95 response time below 200 ms for a named request mix, concurrency, and deployment class. A child links to that constraint and verifies its route locally. The parent verifies the integrated service under the stated workload; the child's local completion does not claim system-level proof.
-->

## Visuals

<!--
- For meaningful architecture, module relationships, interactions, or lifecycle changes, show proportionate before/after visuals using a suitable GitHub-supported Mermaid type.
- Tiny changes may use clear before/after prose.
- Inspect current source or contracts.
- Identify the verified before revision.
- Distinguish proposed additions, changes, and removals.
- Label historical or illustrative designs.
- Correct the proposal when verified implementation differs.
- Show only affected context.
- Check diagram accuracy against source and contracts.
- Use real Mermaid fences so `make doc-check` validates rendering syntax.

Passing rendering does not establish acceptance or GitHub/browser parity.
-->

## Acceptance criteria

<!-- List of acceptance criteria. REQUIRED.

A Work owns one coherent outcome. Acceptance criteria state independently assessable conditions or behaviors that establish it; together, they fulfill the Work’s purpose and goals without a target number of criteria.

- Name each guarantee in the heading.
- Start its criterion with a short sentence stating what becomes possible or changes when it is delivered.
- Include preconditions, expected results, relevant success, failure, refusal, preservation, and compatibility boundaries, and affected interfaces with useful signatures and types needed to determine completion.
- Keep multiple scenarios that establish the same guarantee together.
- Use separate criteria for guarantees that can be assessed independently.
- A condition need not describe runtime behavior when the outcome is guidance, an Investigation, or an Evaluation.
- Given/When/Then is optional.
- Use Given/When/Then when it makes a condition easier to assess.
- State measurement thresholds and the workload and measurement conditions needed to interpret them when they define success.
- Put inherited constraints in the optional [Inherited constraints](#inherited-constraints) section, separately from local acceptance criteria.
- A child may add constraints but cannot weaken a parent's shared guarantees.
- Describe the delivered result rather than listing implementation tasks or instructions to the executor.
- Keep each requirement at one owner.
- Link to each requirement elsewhere.
- Leave implementation details owned by child Works in those contracts.
- Omit empty criterion subheadings.

<!-- AC code outcome example:

### **AC-1 TODO** Executed purchases update cash and positions correctly

Applying a valid purchase fill produces a successor portfolio reflecting the purchased quantity, execution price, and fees.

#### Purchase without fees

- **Given** a portfolio with USD 1,000 cash and no positions.
- **When** a fill purchases two shares of XYZ at USD 100 each, with no fees.
- **Then** the successor portfolio contains USD 800 cash and two shares of XYZ.

#### Purchase with fees

- **Given** a portfolio with USD 1,000 cash and no positions.
- **When** a fill purchases two shares of XYZ at USD 100 each, with a total fee of USD 5.
- **Then** the successor portfolio contains USD 795 cash and two shares of XYZ.
-->

<!-- AC guidance outcome example:

### **AC-2 TODO** Complete record validation

Engineering guidance requires constructors to validate every consumed field and cross-field invariant before returning a domain value. Rejection may stop at the first error; successful construction guarantees all invariants hold. A compact example shows valid construction and rejection of an invalid field combination. If a child implements a particular constructor, it links to this shared invariant and states its own observable acceptance conditions separately.

For constraint inheritance and system-level verification examples, see [Inherited constraints](#inherited-constraints).
-->

## Dependencies

<!--
- List prerequisite Works, their purpose, and prerequisite explanation.
- Do **NOT** include direct children.
- Use `STATUS [Work title](path/to/README.md): purpose.`
- Ordinary guidance links have no Work status.
- Keep purpose text aligned with the linked Work.
- See [Work lifecycle](workflow.md#lifecycle) for status and retention rules.

Example:

- TODO [Dependency Work name](link/to/work/README.md): Dependency purpose from its Work contract.
    It provides API or mechanism that this Work consumes.
-->

## Children

<!--
- List direct child Works and their purpose.
- Use `STATUS [Work title](path/to/README.md): purpose.`
- Keep purpose text aligned with the child Work.
- See [Work lifecycle](workflow.md#lifecycle) for status and retention rules.

Example:

- TODO [Child Work name](child/README.md): Child purpose.
-->

## Links

<!-- List of other relevant links, e.g. to previously closed Investigation or Evaluation Works with one sentence description of why are they relevant to this Work. -->

## Additional context

<!--
- Include useful context not covered above, including assumptions and open risks that affect the Work.
- Distinguish required contracts from provisional design.
- Keep shared context in the parent.
- Keep local detail in the affected leaf.
- Link instead of copying diagrams or API descriptions.
